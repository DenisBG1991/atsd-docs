# Graphite

[Graphite](https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a monitoring tool that stores numeric time-series data and renders graphs of this data on demand.

Axibase Time Series Database supports Graphite format and Pickle protocol, so tools that send data to Graphite can also send data to ATSD.

ATSD has a Storage Finder for Graphite-Web, meaning that you can use ATSD as the back-end for Graphite replacing or augmenting the default Whisper database.

[Learn more about ATSD Storage Finder here.](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/writing-data/graphite/storage-finder/)
