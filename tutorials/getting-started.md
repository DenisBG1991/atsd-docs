# Hello World – Getting started with ATSD

The purpose of this article is to guide the user through his first steps when starting out with Axibase Time-Series Database.

##### Step 1:

[Download and Install Axibase Time-Series Database.](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/download-atsd/)

##### Step 2:

Login into ATSD web interface at https://atsd_hostname:8443/

##### Step 3:

Open the Data Entry page located under the Metrics tab in the top menu:

Complete the Entity, Metric and Value fields, then press Send:

```properties
metric = my-metric
entity = my-entity
value = 24
```

To simplify this example, we will ignore tags. [Tags can be used to enrich the time series.](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/data-model/entity-and-metric-tags/)

##### Step 4:

Execute multiple inserts with different timestamps, e.g. 5 minutes ago, 15 minutes, 1 hour ago, by modifying Time field.

Make sure to enter different time for each insert.

Time format is set to current time by default in [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

You can simply change the minutes and hours:

2016-02-15T12:35:00Z

2016-02-15T12:20:00Z

2016-02-15T11:30:00Z

##### Step 5:

Open a time chart using the following link: [http://atsd_server:8088/portals/series?entity=my-entity&metric=my-metric](http://atsd_server:8088/portals/series?entity=my-entity&metric=my-metric)

In the upper right corner switch to [detail] data type to view the values you inserted before.

Click [all] in the timespan control to view all data instead of last 24 hours.
