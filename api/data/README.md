## Overview

The Data API lets you insert and retrieve series, properties, messages, and alerts from Axibase Time Series Database. 

## Categories

* Series
  - [insert](series/insert.md)
  - [csv insert](series/csv-insert.md)
  - [query](series/query.md)
  - [url query](series/url-query.md)
* Properties
  - [insert](properties/insert.md)
  - [query](properties/query.md)
  - [url query](properties/url-query.md)
  - [type query](properties/type-query.md)
  - [delete](properties/delete.md)
* Messages
  - [insert](messages/insert.md)
  - [query](messages/query.md)
  - [stats](messages/stats-query.md)
* Alerts
  - [query](alerts/query.md)
  - [update](alerts/update.md)
  - [delete](alerts/delete.md)
  - [history query](alerts/history-query.md)
* Extended
  - [command insert](ext/command.md)
  - [csv upload](ext/csv.md)

## Request Methods

The API uses `POST` method to read, write, and delete data except for url [series](series/url-query.md) and [property](properties/url-query.md) queries.

## Request Headers

When submitting payload with `POST` method in JSON format, add header `Content-Type: application/json`.

For correct Unicode handling, specify charset `Content-Type: application/json;chartset=UTF-8`.

## URI Encoding

Request parameter values and parameterized path segments such as [`/api/v1/properties/{entity}/types`](data/properties/property-types.md) should be [URL encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) to translate special characters such as `: / ? # [ ] @` into a percent format that can be transmitted safely as part of the request URI.

| **Input** | **Encoded Value** | **URI** |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`station/24`|`station%2F24`| /api/v1/properties/**station%2F24**/types |

Failure to encode URI components may result in 4xx and 5xx errors:

```json
Status Code: 500
{"error":"...HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException: Request method 'GET' not supported"}
```

## Number Formatting

* Decimal separator is period (`.`).
* No thousands separator.
* No digit grouping.
* Negative numbers use negative sign (`-`) at the beginning of the number.
* Not-a-Number is literal `NaN` unless specified [otherwise](data/series/insert.md#fields).

## Syntax

* entity, metric, property type, property key name, and tag name must consist from printable characters.
* entity, metric, property type, property key name, property key value, and tag name is case-insensitive and is converted to lowercase when stored in ATSD. Other values are case-sensitive and are stored as received.
* Values are trimmed of starting and trailing line breaks (CR,LF symbols).

## Response Codes

* `200` status code if the request is successful.
* `401` status code in case of unknown resource.
* `403` status code in case of access denied error.
* `4xx` status code in case of other client errors.
* `5xx` status code in case of server error. 

4xx or 5xx response codes are specific to each API methods.

## Errors

Processing errors are returned in json format:

```json
{"error":"Empty first row"}
```

## Authentication

* User [authentication](/administration/user-authentiication.md) is required.
* All requests must be authenticated using BASIC AUTHENTICATION.
* Authentication method is **HTTP BASIC**.
* Client may use session cookies to execute multiple requests without repeating authentication.

## Authorization

* User must have [**API_DATA_READ**/**API_DATA_WRITE**](/administration/user-authorization.md#available-api-roles) role.
* User must have read/write [**entity permission**](/administration/user-authorization.md#entity-permissions) for specific or all entities.
 
## Cross-domain Requests

Cross-domain requests are allowed. 

The server includes the following headers in each response:

```yaml
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## Compression

* Clients may send compressed data by adding HTTP header **Content-Encoding: gzip** to the request.

## Troubleshooting

* Review error logs on **Admin:Server Logs** page in case the payload rejected
* To validate json received from a client, launch `netcat` utility in server mode, reconfigure the client to send data to netcat port, and dump incoming data to file:

```elm
nc -lk 0.0.0.0 20088 > json-in.log &

curl http://localhost:20088/api/v1/series/insert \
  -v -u {username}:{password} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '[{"entity": "nurswgvml007", "metric": "mpstat.cpu_busy", "data": [{ "t": 1462427358127, "v": 22.0 }]}]'

cat json-in.log
```
